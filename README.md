# Railway-Reservation-System
-----------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------
It is the complete “Railway Reservation System”. This system is basically concerned with the reservation and cancellation of railway tickets to the passengers. The need of this system arose because as is the known fact that India has the largest railway network in the whole of the world and to handle it manually is quite a tough job. By computerizing it, we will be able to overcome many of its limitations and will be able to make it more efficient. The handling of data and records for such a vast system is a very complex task if done manually but it can be made much easier if the system is computerized.

.NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.
With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, and IoT.


You can write .NET apps in C#, F#, or Visual Basic.
------------------------
C# is a simple, modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.

F# is a cross-platform, open-source, functional programming language for .NET. It also includes object-oriented and imperative programming.

Visual Basic is an approachable language with a simple syntax for building type-safe, object-oriented apps.


Cross Platform
-----------------
Whether you're working in C#, F#, or Visual Basic, your code will run natively on any compatible OS. Different .NET implementations handle the heavy lifting for you:

.NET Core is a cross-platform .NET implementation for websites, servers, and console apps on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

.NET Framework supports websites, services, desktop apps, and more on Windows.

Xamarin/Mono is a .NET implementation for running apps on all the major mobile operating systems.

One consistent API
---------
.NET Standard is a base set of APIs that are common to all .NET implementations.

Each implementation can also expose additional APIs that are specific to the operating systems it runs on. For example, .NET Framework is a Windows-only .NET implementation that includes APIs for accessing the Windows Registry.

Open-source
-----------
.NET is open source and under the .NET Foundation. The .NET Foundation is an independent organization to foster open development and collaboration around the .NET ecosystem.
Because .NET is open source, you can join the 60,000 developers and 3,700 companies already contributing to the .NET platform.
Get quick answers to questions with an active community of developers on Stack Overflow.

Tools
---------
The Visual Studio product family provides a great .NET development experience on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
The Visual Studio Marketplace has thousands of editor extensions from Microsoft and others.
If you prefer to use a different editor, there are .NET command line tools and plugins for many popular editors
