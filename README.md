INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------
It is the complete “Railway Reservation System”. This system is basically concerned with the reservation and cancellation of railway tickets to the passengers. The need of this system arose because as is the known fact that India has the largest railway network in the whole of the world and to handle it manually is quite a tough job. By computerizing it, we will be able to overcome many of its limitations and will be able to make it more efficient. The handling of data and records for such a vast system is a very complex task if done manually but it can be made much easier if the system is computerized.


OBJECTIVES
--------------------------

	Give full control to Data.


	Platform independent.


	Better service to the Users 


	Flexibility of the system is improved 


	Cost of developing and maintaining systems is lower 


	Standards can be enforced

NEED FOR COMPUTERIZATION 
--------------------------------------
